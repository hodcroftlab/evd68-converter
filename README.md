This web tool lets you convert between the **original Fermon annotation** and the **corrected genome annotation** for *Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68)*.

## 🔍 Features

- Enter a **Nucleotide Position** to view the corresponding gene and amino acid in both annotations.
- Enter a **Fermon (GenBank)** gene and amino acid to see the corrected annotation and nucleotide position.
- Enter a **Fermon (Corrected)** gene and amino acid to find the original Fermon position and nucleotide position.
- Visualize changes caused by the VP1/VP3 shift.

## 🚀 How to Use
